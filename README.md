Website for BOO — psychedelic rock from Kelowna, BC.

## The Story

BOO came together in 2024 after Jeff lost his brother Kyle, who fronted Fields of Green. Jeff found Kyle's unreleased recordings and picked up a guitar to bring those songs back to life. Joe (who played with Kyle and mentored Jeff), Johnny (Fields of Green's drummer), and Shawn on bass complete the lineup.

The music draws from good times, loss, love, and the need to create something others can connect with.
